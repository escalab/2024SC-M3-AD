\section{Overview of Contributions and Artifacts}

\subsection{Paper's Main Contributions}

% \artexpl{Provide a list of all main contributions of the paper.}
This paper proposes \MPCMXU{}, which is a multi-mode matrix processing unit 
that supports IEEE 754 single-precision and complex 32-bit floating-point computations. 
\MPCMXU{} consists of 
(1) additions of logic to feed different parts of inputs, 
(2) extensions to the arithmetic units to support exact FP32 precisions, and 
(3) slight extensions to accumulators to accumulate numbers in double-precision formats. 
M3XU enables MXUs to handle standard FP32 floating-point numbers and FP32C complex numbers adeptly, 
achieving their theoretical throughput under current memory technologies and with relatively minor area overhead.
The following is a list of the main contributions of the paper.

% A workflow may consist of three tasks: $T_1, T_2$, and $T_3$. The task $T_1$ may generate a specific dataset. This dataset is then used as input by a computational task $T_2$, and the output of $T_2$ is processed by another task $T_3$, which produces the final results (e.g., plots, tables, etc.). State the individual tasks $T_i$ and provide their dependencies, e.g., $T_1 \rightarrow T_2 \rightarrow T_3$.

% Provide details on the experimental parameters. How and why were parameters set to a specific value (if relevant for the reproduction of an artifact), e.g., size of dataset, number of data points, input sizes, etc. Additionally, include details on statistical parameters, like the number of repetitions.
