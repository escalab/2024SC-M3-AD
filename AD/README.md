# SC24 Guidelines for Paper Authors

## Can authors reference figures or tables from the AD/AE Appendices in the paper?

No, a paper should be self-consistent, as reviewers assess solely the manuscript.
Accordingly, authors should avoid forward referencing figures or tables in the AD/AE Appendices.

Authors can incorporate a "conventional" appendix into their manuscript, which will count towards the 10-page limit, ensuring it is integrated into the main document.

In contrast, the AD/AE Appendices should only be used to describe the computational artifacts (AD)
and how to execute them by example on a designated computational plaform (AE).

## How to deal with proprietary code or other legal constraints?

After submitting a paper to SC24 via [https://submissions.supercomputing.org/](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/), author have the option to upload an AD Appendix.


In certain cases, authors might be unable to share the full computational artifact accompanying a paper. Under these circumstances, they have two alternatives.

1. On [https://submissions.supercomputing.org/](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/), authors may choose not to submit an AD Appendix, such as in cases of proprietary code restrictions. If authors opt-out, they must provide a detailed explanation on why 
an AD Appendix could not be provided. This explanation will be entered directly in the submission system (i.e., the explanation is not part of the AD Appendix).
2. (preferred) Even in scenarios where the disclosure of source code is not feasible, authors are still encouraged to compile an Artifact Description (AD) Appendix, encapsulating all other important information of the computationl artifact. 
Authors should follow the provided AD/AE template and fill in as much information as can be shared. 
For instance, if a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for a computational artifact cannot be provided, authors may simply enter "N/A" or "N/A (proprietary)" in the corresponding section of the AD Appendix.
